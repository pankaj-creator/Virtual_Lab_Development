#### 1. Focus Area : Exprimentation and Data Analysis

The students know the concept of thermosetting plastic ,condensation polymerization,molecular reaction. They do the experimentation based on the formula, trial and error and learn from it. They do the experiment in the presence an acid catalyst. When phenol reacts with excess formaldehyde, a linear P-F(Phenol- formaldehyde) resin novolac is formed and when urea reacts with formaldehyde in the presence of sulphuric acid, a U-F(Urea-formaldehyde) is formed.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b>  
With sample procedure provided by default user, students will able to perform the experiment.They proceed the stpes by hitting "Procedure" button shown on simulator to understand the concepts.<br>Procedure button is different for different procedures accordingly.  </u>
<br>
On click "select" button they will be able to add particular apparatus and by hitting "start" button they will be able to start the use of that apparatus and finally analyzed the result.
Both Phenol-formaldehyde simulator and urea-formaldehyde simulator work on same strategy.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Describe the method for condensation polymerization <br> Condensation polymers are any kind of polymers formed through a condensation reaction—where molecules join together—losing small molecules as byproducts such as water or methanol. | Students see the "procedure" section <br> on simulator for concepts, steps and all information. | What is condensation polymerization?
2.| Predict the effect of temperature on condensation process <br>  | Student will predict the changes occurrs<br> in the product when beaker is on hot-plate .  | what this e nature of the product?
3.| Examine the nature of Phenol-formaldehyde(P-F) resin on heating <br>  |  Students click on "add" button for adding required apparatus and chemicals <br> and by clicking on "select" button they will able to select particular reagent.  |  Phenol formaldehyde is in form of:- <br> <b>A. Solid<br></b> B. Liquid <br> C. Gas <br> D. Plasma
4.| Identify the adhessive behaviour<br> of Phenol-formaldehyde(P-F) resin   |  Students click on "excute" button for identifying <br> the final product. |  What is the  color of P-F resin?
5.| Examine the nature of <br> urea-formaldehyde(U-F) resin   |  Students see the simulator for identifying <br> the changes in mixture. |  What is the  color of U-F resin?
6.| Identify the  behaviour of<br> Urea-formaldehyde(U-F) mixture when sulphuric acid is added    |  Students click on "excute" button for identifying <br> the final product. |  What is the  nature of U-F resin?

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Open the simulator<br> by clicking <br>"Start" button and by selecting the "experiment" name. | The simulator is open <br> in its initial scale  | To show the starting condition of simulator.
2.| Notice the "Procedure" <br> and respective buttons<br> used in simulator.  | The simulator will show the <br> procedures one by one.  | To show the procedures.
3.| Select the apparatus <br> from the apparatus box <br> on clicking "Select" button. | The simulator animate that <br> apparatus as per requirement.'  | Students will able to understand how the experiment is going on.
4.| Select the reagent <br> from the reagent box <br> on clicking "Select" button | The simulator animate that reagent <br> as per requirement.'  |  Student will able to understand how the reagent will work on this experiment and they visualized all the reactions.
