# The procedure of preparation of Phenol-formaldehyde resin is 
1. Take 2 grams of phenol and 10 ml of Glacial acetic acid in 250 ml beaker.<br>
2. Add 5 ml of 40% formaldehyde solution in to it.<br>
3. Slowely add 2 ml of concentration HCl in to the mixture carefully and heat it slightly.<br>
4. Within few minutes, a large mass of pink plastic is formed.<br>
5. Wash this product, several times, with distilled water.<br>
6. Filter, dry and measure the weight of the formed pink plastic.<br>
7. Phenol-formaldehyde is formed with pink color.<br>
