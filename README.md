# Virtual Lab Development

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of virtual laboratory experiments designed for educational purposes. The virtual labs provide interactive simulations and learning experiences for students in various disciplines including Computer Science and Engineering Chemistry.

## Available Experiments

### Data Structure Lab Experiments

1. **Circular Queue using Array** - Implementation and visualization of circular queue data structure using arrays
2. **Queue using Array** - Basic queue implementation using arrays with FIFO operations
3. **Queue using Linked List** - Queue implementation using linked list data structure

### Chemistry Lab Experiments

1. **Phenol-formaldehyde Resin** - Preparation and study of thermosetting plastics

## Target Audience

- B. Tech. 1st and 2nd year students
- Faculty and educators
- Students interested in data structures and chemistry concepts

## Course Alignment

- **Data Structure Labs**: KCS 351 Data Structure Lab (AKTU)
- **Chemistry Labs**: KAS-152/252 Chemistry Practical (AKTU)

## Structure

Each experiment folder contains:
- `experiment/` - Core experimental content including theory, procedure, and simulation
- `pedagogy/` - Educational methodology and teaching approaches
- `storyboard/` - Visual storyboards, flowcharts, and mind maps

## Getting Started
