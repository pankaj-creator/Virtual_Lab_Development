# Implementation of Circular Queue using Array

## Experiment Overview

**Discipline:** Computer Science and Engineering  
**Lab:** Data Structure Lab  
**Experiment:** Implementation of Circular Queue using array

## About the Lab

The objective of this lab is to teach students various data structures and algorithms for performing operations on these structures. This lab complements the data structures course and provides practical knowledge through hands-on implementation of algorithms using data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

## About the Experiment

This experiment focuses on the implementation of a circular queue using arrays. A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, where the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. This implementation efficiently utilizes memory by reusing empty spaces created by dequeue operations.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Circular queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- Array-based implementation
- Memory optimization techniques
- FIFO principle application

## Target Audience

- B. Tech. 2nd year students
- Faculty and educators
- Students learning data structures
