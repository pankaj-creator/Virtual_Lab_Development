# Implementation of Queue using Array

## Experiment Overview

**Discipline:** Computer Science and Engineering  
**Lab:** Data Structure Lab  
**Experiment:** Implementation of Queue using array

## About the Lab

The objective of this lab is to teach students various data structures and algorithms for performing operations on these structures. This lab complements the data structures course and provides practical knowledge through hands-on implementation of algorithms using data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and search trees.

## About the Experiment

This experiment focuses on the implementation of a queue using arrays. The experiment demonstrates the basic principle of queues, which follows FIFO (First In First Out) methodology. Students will learn how to implement queue operations using array-based data structures.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Queue data structure fundamentals
- FIFO (First In First Out) principle
- Array-based queue implementation
- Enqueue and dequeue operations
- Queue overflow and underflow conditions

## Target Audience

- B. Tech. 2nd year students
- Faculty and educators
- Students learning data structures

## Course Information

- **Course:** KCS 351 Data Structure Lab
- **University:** AKTU (Abdul Kalam Technical University)

## Experiment Structure

- **Theory:** Fundamental concepts of queues
- **Procedure:** Step-by-step implementation guide
- **Simulation:** Interactive queue operations and visualization
- **Assessment:** Pre-test and post-test evaluation
