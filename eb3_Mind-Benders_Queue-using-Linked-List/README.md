# Implementation of Queue using Linked List

## Experiment Overview

**Discipline:** Computer Science and Engineering  
**Lab:** Data Structure Lab  
**Experiment:** Implementation of Queue using Linked List

## About the Lab

The objective of this lab is to teach students various data structures and algorithms for performing operations on these structures. This lab complements the data structures course and provides practical knowledge through hands-on implementation of algorithms using data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and search trees.

## About the Experiment

This experiment focuses on the implementation of a queue using linked lists. The experiment demonstrates the basic principle of queues following FIFO (First In First Out) methodology using dynamic memory allocation through linked structures.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Queue implementation using linked lists
- Dynamic memory allocation
- FIFO (First In First Out) principle
- Node-based data structure
- Front and rear pointer management
- Memory efficiency in queue operations

### Technical Details:
In a linked queue, each node consists of two parts:
- **Data part:** Stores the actual data element
- **Link part:** Contains the address of the next node

The implementation maintains two pointers:
- **Front pointer:** Points to the starting element of the queue
- **Rear pointer:** Points to the last element of the queue

## Target Audience

- B. Tech. 2nd year students
- Faculty and educators
- Students learning data structures and dynamic memory management

## Experiment Structure

- **Theory:** Fundamental concepts of linked queues
- **Procedure:** Step-by-step implementation guide
- **Simulation:** Interactive linked queue operations and visualization
- **Assessment:** Pre-test and post-test evaluation
